# SalesScope
An end-to-end data analytics project that builds an interactive sales dashboard with dynamic KPIs, top customers/products, and sales forecasting. This project demonstrates how to take raw sales data → clean it → model it in SQL → analyze KPIs → forecast future sales → and finally visualize everything in Power BI/Tableau.
